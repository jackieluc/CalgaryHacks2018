## Theme
**Long Range (Cellular) Internet of Things (IoT)**

## Purpose
Our homes are one of the most valuable financial assets we hold in our lives. They house countless precious memories and we invest a lot of effort to attain and maintain our homes, and even go the extra length make it personable and welcoming. You own a cabin or a cottage that you wish you could visit multiple times during the year, rather than once a summer. You may possibly arrive in the start of your summer vacation away from the busy city life to find yourself with an array of problems with your cabin, and you wished you had known of these issues earlier, so that these issues could have been addressed before your vacation started. House Guard is a home monitoring system equipped with several sensors to detect and alert any problems to you using cellular data. House Guard can put your mind at peace, displaying the health status of your home's temperature, air quality, humidity, and detect motion, in a mobile-friendly and real-time dashboard. The dashboard also enables you to analyze the data of your home, which can assist you in making informed decisions, such as, seeing areas to improve efficiencies or predict problems. In an event where a sensor is detecting abnormal activity, it will send an alert to you through a text message. You can easily configure the threshold of each sensors to configure when an alert needs to be sent. You can also provide a subscription to these alerts, enabling notifications to your plumber if your humidity is abnormally high, or the fire department if your house is abnormally hot. There is no more need for you to spend lengths of time to physically travel to check the status of your beloved remote homes.
